# PCSA Project 2: IC Web Server

You are building a web server. In terms of features, your server will 

* handle a subset of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, as detailed in RFC2616, and
* support the common gateway interface (CGI), as detailed in RFC3875. 

In terms of performance, your server is expected to be highly concurrent&mdash;capable of serving tens of hundreds of requests of static requests per second.
